> ## Now you have the power !! USE IT !!

First of all pull this repo...  
Than you should see some files  

The `package.json` file has informations about the project packages and
commands  
To pull the packages type the command  

```bash
npm install
```

The `webpack.config.js` file define your webpack configuration...ignore for now...   

---

The entry (as defined in package and webpack configs) is the `index.js` file.
Open it and you should see something familiar.

Now open the source folder and start play with the `App.js`

> NOTE
> Bootstrap is loaded from the index.js file and bundlelized so go straight with the whole app.


## ENJOY
